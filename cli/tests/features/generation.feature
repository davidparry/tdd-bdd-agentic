Feature: Hybrid generation into staging
  Step definitions and unit tests are generated from deterministic
  templates that always work. When an LLM model is resolved its output is
  preferred - but only after validation; anything unusable falls back to
  the template silently. Generated code lands in the staging area, never
  in working files, so the human reviews before anything is applied.

  Background:
    Given a Java project marker
    And a project feature file "features/calc.feature" containing:
