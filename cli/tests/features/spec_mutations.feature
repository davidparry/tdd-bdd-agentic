Feature: Spec mutations
  As a developer who owns the spec wording
  I want drafting, status flips, and scenario edits staged and gated
  So that the spec stays the reviewed source of truth

  Background:
    Given a working spec with the pending requirement "REQ-001"

  Scenario: A clean draft is staged under the next free id
    Given the developer will answer:
      """
      Comma sums
      As a user, I want comma sums so that totals come from one input.
      Given the input "1,2", when add is called, then the result is 3
      Given an empty string "", when add is called, then the result is 0
      <empty>
      y
      """
    When a requirement is drafted
    Then the draft is staged as "REQ-002"
