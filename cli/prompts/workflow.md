The bdd CLI drives a spec-driven BDD/TDD workflow. The requirements spec
(requirements/requirements.json) is the source of truth. Every requirement
(REQ-XXX) moves from status "pending" to "implemented" through the loop
below. The goal: every requirement implemented, validated, and committed.

STATES

TDD phases, recorded in .bdd-state.json by bdd test and bdd refactor:
- START: no test run is recorded yet.
- RED: the last test run failed.
- GREEN: the last test run passed.
- REFACTOR: a refactor is in progress on a green bar.

Requirement statuses: "pending" (not done yet) and "implemented" (done -
the spec names its featureFile and a scenario tagged @REQ-XXX exists).

The staging area: every authoring command stages its edits instead of
writing the working tree. Review with bdd changes show, apply with bdd
changes commit, drop with bdd changes discard. Staged changes always come
first - nothing else moves until they are committed or discarded.

TWO TEST ALTITUDES, ONE BAR

This is the BDD outside-in double loop. The scenario tagged @REQ-XXX is
the outer, acceptance-level loop; the unit test (Req*Test) is the inner,
TDD-level loop. bdd test runs both under one shared RED/GREEN bar: a
failing scenario step means step-definition or production work, a failing
unit test means production work at the unit level.

THE LOOP FOR ONE REQUIREMENT

1. bdd spec draft - word the requirement (title, story, Given/When/Then
   acceptance criteria); validate and refine findings drive rewording
   until clean; then bdd changes commit.
2. bdd scenario add --feature <file> --req REQ-XXX --name <name> --step
   ... - formulate the acceptance criteria as a Gherkin scenario tagged
   @REQ-XXX (bdd feature create first if the feature file does not
   exist); then bdd changes commit.
3. bdd steps generate - scaffold step definitions for undefined steps;
   then bdd changes commit.
4. bdd unittest generate REQ-XXX - scaffold the failing unit test from
   the acceptance criteria; then bdd changes commit.
5. bdd test - expect RED: the new scenario and unit test fail because
   the behavior is not implemented.
6. bdd implement REQ-XXX - the model writes production code (or
   implement by hand); then bdd changes commit and bdd test again.
   Repeat while the bar stays RED.
7. On GREEN, optionally bdd refactor --note <what> - clean up, then
   bdd test to prove the bar stayed green.
8. bdd spec mark-implemented REQ-XXX - flips the status and records the
   featureFile (only allowed on GREEN); then bdd validate (it checks the
   @REQ-XXX scenario exists), then bdd changes commit.
9. Back to step 1 for the next pending requirement, or done.

COMMANDS

- bdd status: where every requirement stands and the one next step.
- bdd state: the current TDD phase and last run counts.
- bdd test [--feature <file>] [--scenario <name>]: run the tests and
  move the phase to RED or GREEN.
- bdd spec list | show REQ-XXX | draft | validate | refine REQ-XXX |
  mark-implemented REQ-XXX: the requirements spec tools.
- bdd feature list | show <path> | create: feature files.
- bdd scenario add | update | delete: tagged scenarios (staged).
- bdd steps missing | generate: step definitions.
- bdd unittest generate REQ-XXX: the unit test scaffold.
- bdd implement REQ-XXX: a model implementation attempt (staged).
- bdd refactor --note <what>: begin a refactor (GREEN only).
- bdd changes show | commit | discard: the staging area.
- bdd validate: parse staged Gherkin and validate the effective spec.

INVARIANTS

- Never refactor on RED - make the tests pass first.
- Never mark a requirement implemented off GREEN.
- Every mutation is staged and reviewed before it touches the working
  tree; run bdd validate before bdd changes commit.
- One requirement in flight at a time; staged changes are handled before
  anything else.
- The loop for a requirement closes only when it is marked implemented,
  validated, and committed.
