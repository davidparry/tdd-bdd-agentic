# The workflow: spec → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR

The CLI enforces a two-altitude test discipline driven by a validated
spec. Understanding the phases makes every command's `nextStep` field
self-explanatory.

## The spec is the entry point

Nothing meaningful happens without `requirements/requirements.json`.
The iteration loop for the spec itself:

1. Draft or edit a requirement — [`bdd spec draft`](commands/spec.md#bdd-spec-draft)
   or your editor.
2. [`bdd spec validate`](commands/spec.md#bdd-spec-validate) until the
   structure is valid.
3. [`bdd spec refine <id>`](commands/spec.md#bdd-spec-refine) until
   there are no wording findings.
4. A human approves the wording. This is the first human gate.

## The two altitudes

- **BDD altitude** — each requirement becomes a Gherkin scenario
  tagged `@REQ-...` in a feature file, with step definitions binding
  it to real code.
- **TDD altitude** — unit tests
  ([`bdd unittest generate`](commands/unittest.md)) pin down the
  fine-grained behavior beneath the scenario.

## The phase machine

The persistent TDD phase lives in `.bdd-tdd-state.json` under the
project root and survives between invocations and across MCP sessions.

```text
          tests fail                    tests pass
  (start) ──────────► RED ────────────► GREEN ──┐
                       ▲                  │     │ bdd refactor
                       │   tests fail     ▼     ▼
                       └────────────── REFACTOR
                                        (tests pass → GREEN)
```

- [`bdd test`](commands/test.md) runs the suite and moves the phase to
  RED (failures) or GREEN (all passing).
- [`bdd refactor`](commands/refactor.md) is only allowed on GREEN — it
  moves to REFACTOR and records your note in the refactor log.
- [`bdd state`](commands/state.md) shows the phase, the last run's
  counts, and the refactor log at any time.
- [`bdd status`](commands/status.md) zooms out from the phase to the
  spec: where every requirement stands on the road to implemented, and
  the single next step for the one that is furthest along.

## One requirement at a time

The intended rhythm for each pending requirement:

```bash
bdd spec show REQ-002        # locations + workflow hint
bdd scenario add --feature features/calculator.feature \
    --req REQ-002 --name "Two numbers are summed" \
    --step 'Given the input "1,2"' \
    --step 'When add is called' \
    --step 'Then the result is 3'
bdd changes commit           # apply the staged scenario
bdd steps missing            # any undefined steps?
bdd steps generate && bdd changes commit
bdd test                     # RED: the scenario fails honestly
# ...implement the production code...
bdd test                     # GREEN
bdd refactor --note "tidy the parser" && bdd test
bdd status                   # confirm REQ-002 is ready to mark
bdd spec mark-implemented REQ-002   # flips the status, records the featureFile
bdd validate                 # checks the @REQ-002 scenario exists
bdd changes commit
```

[`bdd greenfield`](commands/greenfield.md) automates exactly this
rhythm, pausing only at the two human gates.
