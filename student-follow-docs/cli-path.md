# Finish the String Calculator workshop with `bdd`

The 60-minute hour in [student-follow-along.md](../student-follow-along.md)
uses Cursor and the Java `tdd-workflow` MCP tools. This page is the same
end state — every requirement `implemented`, including Exercise 1’s
**REQ-007** — driven with the `bdd` CLI instead.

Do **not** work on `trunk`. `scripts/check-workshop-start.sh` must keep
passing there.

## Install

From the repository root, after a Rust toolchain is on your PATH:

```bash
cargo install --path cli
bdd --version
```

A local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) model is optional. It is only
required for `bdd implement`. Without one, implement
`StringCalculator.java` by hand after the tests go RED.

```bash
# optional
ollama pull qwen3-coder-next:latest
bdd model use qwen3-coder-next:latest
```

## Files this loop must reuse

Do not invent parallel classes. Generation and implement look for the
existing kata files:

| Role | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Feature | `kata/src/test/resources/features/string_calculator.feature` |
| Steps | `kata/src/test/java/com/davidparry/workshop/kata/StringCalculatorSteps.java` |
| Unit tests | `kata/src/test/java/com/davidparry/workshop/kata/StringCalculatorTest.java` |
| Production | `kata/src/main/java/com/davidparry/workshop/kata/StringCalculator.java` |

Existing steps already bind `Given a string calculator`, `When I add {string}`,
`Then the result is {int}`, and the negatives exception step. Prefer those
wordings so `bdd steps generate` is a no-op.

Every authoring command **stages**. Review with `bdd changes show`, then
`bdd changes commit`. `bdd test` runs Maven on the **working tree**, so
commit before you trust the bar. `bdd spec mark-implemented` is allowed
only on GREEN.

## Step 1 — Branch and baseline

```bash
git checkout -b workshop trunk
bdd spec validate                 # valid; featureFile paths exist in this repo
bdd spec list                     # REQ-001/002 implemented; REQ-003..006 pending; no REQ-007
bdd test                          # GREEN: 2 JUnit + 3 Cucumber
```

If you already have CLI fixes on another branch, cut `workshop` from
that branch instead of `trunk` so `bdd test` understands this repo.

## Step 2 — Exercise 1: draft REQ-007 (status stays `pending`)

```bash
bdd spec draft \
  --title "Newlines as delimiters" \
  --story "As a calculator user, I want newlines to separate numbers in addition to commas so that multi-line input just works." \
  --criterion 'Given the input "1\n2,3", when add is called, then the result is 6' \
  --criterion 'Given an empty string "", when add is called, then the result is 0'
bdd changes commit
bdd spec refine REQ-007
# if findings: bdd spec reword REQ-007 && bdd changes commit, then refine again
bdd spec list                     # REQ-007 pending
```

A similar title or criterion to REQ-001 / REQ-005 may print a warning.
That does not block staging. Do **not** mark REQ-007 implemented yet.

## Recipe used for every pending requirement

```text
bdd spec show REQ-00N
bdd scenario add --feature kata/src/test/resources/features/string_calculator.feature \
  --req REQ-00N --name "<scenario>" \
  --step 'Given a string calculator' \
  --step 'When I add "<input>"' \
  --step 'Then the result is <n>'
# second criterion: another scenario add with the same --req
bdd unittest generate REQ-00N     # appends StringCalculatorTest, does not create Req00NTest
bdd changes commit
bdd test                          # expect RED
bdd implement REQ-00N             # or edit StringCalculator.java by hand
bdd changes commit && bdd test    # GREEN
bdd refactor --note "<what>" && bdd test    # optional, GREEN only
bdd spec mark-implemented REQ-00N
bdd changes commit
bdd spec list
```

## Step 3 — Exercise 2: take REQ-003 to `implemented`

```bash
bdd spec show REQ-003
bdd scenario add --feature kata/src/test/resources/features/string_calculator.feature \
  --req REQ-003 --name "Two numbers separated by a comma are summed" \
  --step 'Given a string calculator' \
  --step 'When I add "1,2"' \
  --step 'Then the result is 3'
bdd scenario add --feature kata/src/test/resources/features/string_calculator.feature \
  --req REQ-003 --name "Two larger numbers separated by a comma are summed" \
  --step 'Given a string calculator' \
  --step 'When I add "10,20"' \
  --step 'Then the result is 30'
bdd unittest generate REQ-003
bdd changes commit
bdd test                          # RED
bdd implement REQ-003 && bdd changes commit && bdd test    # GREEN, or edit by hand
bdd spec mark-implemented REQ-003 && bdd changes commit
```

## Step 4 — Remaining pending: REQ-004, REQ-005, REQ-006, then REQ-007

Repeat the recipe. Suggested scenarios (reuse existing steps):

| Id | Scenario name | When I add | Then |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-004 | Any amount of numbers is summed | `"1,2,3,4,5"` | result is 15 |
| REQ-004 | All zeros sum to zero | `"0,0,0"` | result is 0 |
| REQ-005 | Newlines work as delimiters alongside commas | `"1\n2,3"` | result is 6 |
| REQ-005 | Newlines alone delimit numbers | `"4\n5\n6"` | result is 15 |
| REQ-006 | A negative number is rejected | `"1,-2"` | `Then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown with a message containing "negatives not allowed"` |
| REQ-006 | Every negative number is listed in the error | `"-1,-2"` | two further `Then`/`And` steps containing `"-1"` and `"-2"` |
| REQ-007 | Newlines as delimiters (workshop draft) | `"1\n2,3"` | result is 6 |

REQ-007 overlaps REQ-005. A second `@REQ-007` scenario is enough for
`mark-implemented`. Dual-tagging one scenario `@REQ-005 @REQ-007` is
optional.

Gherkin cannot put a real newline inside `"…"`. Write `\n` in the
`When I add` string; `StringCalculatorSteps` unescapes it.

## Step 5 — Done

```bash
bdd spec list
# every id REQ-001 .. REQ-007 status: implemented
bdd spec validate
bdd test                          # GREEN
```

That is the CLI success bar: **every requirement status is
`implemented`**. `scripts/verify-workshop-run.sh check` also wants the
`complete` branch’s exact scenario text and method name
`twoCommaSeparatedNumbersAreSummed`; that grader stays the MCP-hour
check. CLI-generated names will usually not match it.

## Reset

Same as the follow-along:

```bash
git checkout -- kata requirements
```

or throw the branch away. Do not merge kata completion to `trunk`.
