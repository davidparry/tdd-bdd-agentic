# The requirements format

`requirements/requirements.json` is the spec — the versioned source of
truth every agent implements from. This chapter is the reference for
its shape: what each field means, who consumes it, and how one file
grows into a **catalog** of many.

One thing to keep straight: **Cucumber never reads this file.**
Cucumber runs the `.feature` files. The spec sits *upstream*: the
tooling (`bdd`, the MCP server) reads it, agents turn its acceptance
criteria into Gherkin scenarios and unit tests, and those are what the
test runner executes.

```text
requirements.json  →  bdd / MCP tools  →  .feature + tests  →  Cucumber/JUnit
```

## The document shape

```json
{
  "project": "String Calculator Kata",
  "description": "What this spec is for, in a sentence or two.",
  "includes": ["core/arithmetic.json"],
  "requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-003",
      "title": "Two numbers separated by a comma are summed",
      "status": "pending",
      "story": "As a user, I want comma-separated numbers to be summed so that I can add multiple values at once.",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Given \"1,2\", when add is called, then the result is 3",
        "Given \"10,20\", when add is called, then the result is 30"
      ],
      "featureFile": "kata/src/test/resources/features/string_calculator.feature"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Top-level fields

| Field | Required | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `project` | root only | The project name. `bdd spec validate` fails when it is blank on the root document; included files never need one. Returned by `list_requirements`, and greenfield mode derives production file names from it. |
| `description` | no | Documentation for humans and agents. The tooling never acts on it. |
| `includes` | no | Child spec files merged into this one — see [the catalog](#the-catalog-splitting-the-spec-across-files). |
| `requirements` | see note | The backlog this file contributes. A file may hold an empty array when it only exists to include others, but the *merged* catalog must contain at least one requirement. |

## Requirement fields

| Field | Required | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | The lookup key, shaped like `REQ-007` (uppercase prefix, dash, number). Must be unique across the **whole catalog** — every included file counts. It is also the tag the workflow expects on the Gherkin scenario (`@REQ-007`); that tag is how a scenario traces back to its requirement. |
| `title` | yes | One line naming the behavior. Shown by `bdd spec list`. |
| `status` | yes | `pending` or `implemented` — nothing else. `bdd spec mark-implemented` flips it on GREEN; the value gates the `featureFile` rules below. |
| `story` | yes | The user story, `As a …, I want … so that …`. `bdd spec refine` reviews it for a missing actor, missing benefit, and ambiguous words. |
| `acceptanceCriteria` | at least one | Each criterion must be phrased Given/When/Then. This is the load-bearing field: agents translate these lines into the Gherkin scenarios and unit tests you then implement. |
| `featureFile` | when implemented | Repo-root-relative path to the feature file carrying the scenario. Optional while `pending`; once `implemented`, validation requires the file to exist *and* to contain a scenario tagged `@<id>`. `bdd spec mark-implemented` records it automatically. |

## The catalog: splitting the spec across files

`requirements/requirements.json` is **always the entry point** — but it
does not have to hold every requirement itself. It is a catalog: it may
carry its own `requirements` *and* an `includes` array of child spec
files. Children use the same document shape and may include further
files, so the tree nests as many levels deep as the backlog needs.

```text
requirements/
├── requirements.json        ← the root catalog (always read first)
├── core/
│   ├── arithmetic.json      ← included by the root
│   └── edge-cases.json      ← included by arithmetic.json
└── validation/
    └── negatives.json       ← included by the root
```

The rules:

- **Paths are relative to the file declaring them.** The root's
  `"core/arithmetic.json"` lives next to the root;
  `arithmetic.json`'s `"edge-cases.json"` lives next to
  `arithmetic.json`. Includes must stay inside the spec directory.
- **Merge order is depth-first**: a file's own requirements first,
  then each include in listed order. `bdd spec list`,
  `list_requirements`, `validate_spec`, and every other tool operate
  on this merged view — one backlog, whatever the file layout.
- **Ids are unique across the tree.** A duplicate id spanning two
  files fails validation naming the file that declared it first.
- **Cycles and missing files are validation issues**, not crashes:
  including a file twice, including a file that does not exist, or
  escaping the spec directory each report a single actionable issue.
- **Mutations write back to the declaring file.** `bdd spec reword`,
  `set-feature`, and `mark-implemented` find the file a requirement
  lives in and stage only that file. `bdd spec draft` appends to the
  root by default, or to a chosen file with `--file`.

### Growing the catalog

```bash
# Stage a new (empty) spec file and the include entry on the root:
bdd spec include add requirements/core/arithmetic.json
bdd changes commit

# Draft directly into it:
bdd spec draft --file requirements/core/arithmetic.json

# Nest deeper: include a file from a child instead of the root:
bdd spec include add requirements/core/edge-cases.json \
  --from requirements/core/arithmetic.json
```

`bdd spec list` names the file each requirement lives in, so the
catalog stays navigable as it grows:

```json
[
  { "id": "REQ-001", "title": "Empty string returns zero", "status": "implemented",
    "file": "requirements/requirements.json" },
  { "id": "REQ-004", "title": "Any amount of numbers is supported", "status": "pending",
    "file": "requirements/core/arithmetic.json" }
]
```

A spec with no `includes` behaves exactly as before — one file, one
backlog. Split it the day it stops fitting in your head.
